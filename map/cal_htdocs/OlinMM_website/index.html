	    <h3>76 Access Points + Software = Localization</h3>
	    <p>
	    	The Marauder's Map @ Olin is an opt-in program that utilizes Olin's wireless access points to generate a map of laptop locations on campus.  By training the system, we correlate access point signal strength to location.  Currently, this method is able to achieve approximately room-level accuracy.

		<h4>3/1/2008 - Release Candidate 1</h4>
	    <p>
			With all the suggestions from the beta we have revamped the web interface and improved the client GUI.  Accuracy is also improved.
		</p>
		<h4>2/5/2008 - Beta Closed</h4>
	    <p>
			The beta test is now closed on account of me turning my computer off at night.  Thanks for all of your suggestions and bug reports!
		</p>
	    <h4>1/24/2008 - Beta Released</h4>
	    <p>
	    	Our first public test!  We have about 10 beta testers on campus, selected through the very scientific method of walking around and asking if people wanted to try it out.
	    </p>	   
	    <h3>Disclaimer!</h3>
	    <p>
	    	Some of you  are thinking "Wow, this is creepy."  Yes, tracking locations is a privacy issue.  This is an opt-in project.  If you don't want to be tracked, don't install.  If you want to be tracked some of the time, turn the client off when you don't want to be found.  We do not keep any logs of location data -- as soon as your location is updated your old information is overwritten.  Keep in mind that just because we do not log the data doesn't mean that logging isn't possible.  The information is public inside of Olin.  That being said, don't log the data.  <em>Respect for Others.</em></span>
