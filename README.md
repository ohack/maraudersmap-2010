Marauder's map helps students see where other students are on Olin's campus.

This is the start of an attempt to modernize __The Marauder's Map @ Olin__, an application written between 2008 and 2010 by Andrew Barry and Ben Fischer, which used wxPython, PHP, and MySQL.


This branch is for client development.

The original client used wxPython. We are attempting to improve it and port it to QT using pyside.
