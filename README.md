Marauder's map helps students see where other students are on Olin's campus.

This is the start of an attempt to modernize __The Marauder's Map @ Olin__, an application written between 2008 and 2010 by Andrew Barry and Ben Fischer, which used wxPython, PHP, and MySQL.


This branch is for client development.

As this repository is __very__ large (this is a separate issue...) a quick way to clone the repository is by simplying cloning this client branch:
```git clone -b client git@github.com:ohack/maraudersmap.git```

The original client used wxPython. We are attempting to improve it and port it to QT using pyside.
